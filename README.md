### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Fuo En, and I go by a very chemistry-related username/nickname of Fe-56. That is because the initials of my given name are F and E.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a Telegram Bot, Android application, and a website for a start-up with my friend, called Lonely No Longer 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the various tech stacks in full-stack development, from the free online courses provided by freeCodeCamp.org
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a suitable route to get into full-stack development, so please contact me if you have any advice on that!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the start-up I mentioned earlier (Lonely No Longer)! I will be glad to answer any queries on that
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can send me an email at limfuoen1999@gmail.com or drop me a mesasge on Telegram at @Fe_56
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I go by a very chemistry-related username/nickname of Fe-56. That is because the initials of my given name are F and E.
