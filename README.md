### Hi there 👋
My name is Fuo En, a Computer Science & Design Junior at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)

- ⭐ My interests lie in Full-Stack Development and Mobile Application Development! I am also exploring being an entrepreneur
- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a full stack web application for a personalised travel itinerary generation for a start-up called Itineratum
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and gaining experience in Next.js for full-stack web development
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with a suitable route to get into mobile app development/full-stack development, so please get in touch with me if you have any advice on that!
- 💬 Ask me about the start-up I mentioned earlier (Itineratum)! I will be glad to answer any queries on that
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me an email at limfuoen1999@gmail.com or drop me a message on Telegram at @Fe_56
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use a very chemistry-related username/nickname of Fe-56. That is because the initials of my given name are F and E, and the chemical symbol of iron is Fe
