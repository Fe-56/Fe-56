### Hi there 👋
My name is Fuo En, a Computer Science & Design Junior at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)

- ⭐ My interests lie in Full-Stack Development, Mobile Application Development and Internet of Things! I am also exploring being an entrepreneur
- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing an Android application (using Flutter) for a start-up called Look and Earn, with my friend
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack for full-stack development, from the free online courses provided by freeCodeCamp.org
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with a suitable route to get into full-stack development, so please contact me if you have any advice on that!
- 💬 Ask me about the start-up I mentioned earlier (Look and Earn)! I will be glad to answer any queries on that
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me an email at limfuoen1999@gmail.com or drop me a mesasge on Telegram at @Fe_56
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I go by a very chemistry-related username/nickname of Fe-56. That is because the initials of my given name are F and E, and the chemical symbol of iron is Fe
